## 👨‍💻 About Me

Experienced Full Stack Engineer with 8+ years building scalable, secure, and user-focused web applications across fintech, real estate, and enterprise sectors.

I specialize in modern JavaScript ecosystems — React, Node.js, TypeScript — and deliver clean, testable, cloud-ready solutions. My recent work includes building:

- A bilingual real estate platform with headless CMS and dynamic routing
- An internal developer portal (Backstage) with CI/CD integrations and RBAC
- Real-time analytics tools for merchant transactions

I emphasize architecture, developer experience, accessibility, and performance.
